# dreistaendegasse

This is my very first project ever. I wrote this website whilst learning the basics of front end development and because it was a constantly changing project 
where appartments would get sold I had to constantly change the website. I did not now about Github then so I would just hide content, because I was too proud 
and scared to delete my work.
